## What is Superliminal About?
 
Superliminal is not just a puzzle game, but also a story about dreams and self-discovery. As you progress through the game, you will hear the voice of Dr. Pierce and other characters who will guide you, mock you, or confuse you. You will also find notes and clues that reveal more about the Somnasculpta program and your own subconscious. The game explores themes such as perception, perspective, reality, and identity, and challenges you to question your own assumptions and beliefs.
 
## What Makes Superliminal Unique?
 
Superliminal stands out from other puzzle games with its creative use of forced perspective and optical illusions. The game constantly surprises you with its clever level design and unexpected twists. You will encounter objects that change shape depending on how you look at them, rooms that defy logic and physics, and environments that shift and transform as you move through them. The game also plays with your expectations and subverts common video game tropes and mechanics. For example, you might find a door that leads to nowhere, a button that does nothing, or a sign that tells you to do the opposite of what it says.
 
## What are the Pros and Cons of Superliminal?
 
Superliminal is a great puzzle experience, full of smart ideas that are richly realized. The game's playful use of the first-person camera and clever perspective manipulation puzzles take video game tropes and mechanics most players will be familiar with and wring something truly fresh out of them. The game also has a charming sense of humor and a delightful soundtrack that enhance the mood and atmosphere. However, Superliminal is not without its flaws. Some of the puzzles can be repetitive or frustrating, especially when the game's mechanics don't work as intended or when the solutions are unclear or arbitrary. The game is also quite short, lasting only about 3 hours on average, and doesn't offer much replay value or incentive to explore further. The game's story is also rather vague and underdeveloped, leaving some questions unanswered and some themes unexplored.
