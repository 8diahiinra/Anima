## Sarkar (2005)
 
Sarkar was inspired by the 1972 Hollywood classic The Godfather, but with a twist. Instead of a mafia family, it portrayed a political family that ruled the city with an iron fist. Amitabh Bachchan played the role of Subhash Nagre, also known as Sarkar, who was revered by the masses as a benevolent leader and feared by his enemies as a ruthless opponent. Abhishek Bachchan played his son Shankar, who initially shunned his father's legacy but later joined him to fight against the corrupt forces that threatened their family and their city. Kay Kay Menon played Vishnu, the other son of Sarkar, who was jealous of Shankar and betrayed his father. The movie also featured Katrina Kaif, Supriya Pathak, Anupam Kher, and Kota Srinivasa Rao in supporting roles.
 
Sarkar was a critical and commercial success. It received positive reviews from critics who praised the performances of Amitabh and Abhishek Bachchan, the direction of Ram Gopal Varma, and the screenplay and dialogues by Manish Gupta. The movie also won several awards, including the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor for Abhishek Bachchan, the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics) for Amitabh Bachchan, and the Zee Cine Award for Best Director for Ram Gopal Varma. The movie also earned â¹393 million at the box office and was declared a hit.

She approached Shankar for his help in convincing the villagers to give up their land for the project. However, things took a dark turn when a series of murders and conspiracies threatened to destroy the Nagre family and their empire. The movie also featured Dilip Prabhavalkar, Govind Namdeo, Rajesh Shringarpure, Sayaji Shinde, and Ravi Kale in supporting roles.
