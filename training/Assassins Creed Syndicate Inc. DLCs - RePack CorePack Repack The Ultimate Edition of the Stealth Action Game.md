Assassin's Creed: Syndicate is the ninth main installment in the Assassin's Creed series, developed by Ubisoft Quebec and published by Ubisoft in 2015. The game received positive reviews from critics and players, who praised its story, characters, gameplay, graphics, and soundtrack. The game also won several awards, including the BAFTA Games Award for Best British Game and the Golden Joystick Award for Best Gaming Moment.
 
The game is set in 1868, during the Industrial Revolution, when London is controlled by the Templars and their allies, such as the Blighters gang and the corrupt police. The Assassins, who have been weakened by the events of the previous games, are trying to regain their influence and liberate the city from oppression. The game follows the adventures of Jacob and Evie Frye, twin siblings who are descendants of the Assassin Edward Kenway. Jacob is a rebellious and charismatic leader who wants to create his own gang, the Rooks, and challenge the Blighters for control of London. Evie is a stealthy and intelligent strategist who wants to find a Piece of Eden, a powerful artifact left by an ancient civilization, before the Templars do.
 
The game allows you to switch between Jacob and Evie at any time, except during some missions that are specific to each character. Each character has their own skills, weapons, and outfits that suit their style of play. Jacob is more suited for combat and uses a kukri knife, a revolver, and brass knuckles. Evie is more suited for stealth and uses a cane sword, a throwing knife, and a hallucinogenic dart. Both characters can use a rope launcher, a device that allows them to quickly traverse the city by grappling onto buildings and ziplines.
