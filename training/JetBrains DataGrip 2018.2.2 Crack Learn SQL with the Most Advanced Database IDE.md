In this article, we will show you how to use SQL Server procedures with DataGrip 2018.2.2 and how to benefit from its smart code completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection.
 
## Creating a SQL Server Procedure
 
To create a SQL Server procedure, you need to have a database connection in DataGrip and open a console for it. Then, you can use the CREATE PROCEDURE statement to define the name, parameters, and body of the procedure. For example, let's create a simple procedure that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum and product as output:

    CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.calc
        @a int,
        @b int,
        @sum int OUTPUT,
        @prod int OUTPUT
    AS
    BEGIN
        SET @sum = @a + @b;
        SET @prod = @a * @b;
    END;

DataGrip will highlight the keywords and parameters of the statement and check for any syntax errors. You can also use the code completion feature to insert predefined templates or snippets for common statements.
 
## Executing a SQL Server Procedure
 
To execute a SQL Server procedure, you can right-click on it in the database explorer and select Execute from the context menu. DataGrip will generate the SQL code for calling the procedure and prompt you to enter the values of the parameters. For example, if we execute the calc procedure we created earlier, we will see this dialog:

After clicking OK, DataGrip will run the procedure and show the results in a separate tab. You can also see the output parameters in the Output Parameters pane:

You can also execute a SQL Server procedure by writing the EXECUTE or EXEC statement in the console and using code completion to fill in the parameter values. DataGrip will suggest the names and types of the parameters and let you choose from a list of possible values:

## Exploring your databases
 
DataGrip is a multi-engine database environment that supports many popular databases, including SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and more. If the DBMS has a JDBC driver, you can connect to it via DataGrip. It provides database introspection and various instruments for creating and modifying objects for the supported engines. You can also compare schemas, view diagrams, and navigate through the data by foreign keys.
 
## Working with data
 
DataGrip is not only a SQL editor, but also a powerful data editor that lets you add, remove, edit, and clone data rows. You can search for anything in the data displayed in the data editor using the text search feature. You can also import and export data in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, HTML, Markdown, Excel, and more. DataGrip also provides a scripting mechanism for export that lets you create any text format you like. Moreover, you can compare data from different tables or query results using the diff viewer.
 
## Code analysis and quick-fixes
 
DataGrip detects where bugs are likely to occur in your SQL code and suggests the best options to fix them on-the-fly. It will immediately let you know about unresolved objects, the use of keywords as identifiers, and always offers you a way to fix the problem. DataGrip also provides code inspections that highlight potential problems and suggest improvements. You can apply quick-fixes to resolve issues or refactor your code with ease.
