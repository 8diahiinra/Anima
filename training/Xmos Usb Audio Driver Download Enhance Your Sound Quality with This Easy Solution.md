If you have a USB audio device that uses XMOS USB chipsets internally, you may need to install a driver to enable its full functionality on Windows. XMOS USB Audio firmware supports both USB Audio Class 1.0 and USB Audio Class 2.0, but Windows 10 and Apple macOS version 10.6.4 and above natively support only USB Audio Class 2.0. For advanced features such as multichannel audio, high sample rates, DSD support, ASIO support, MIDI support, HID support, and DFU support, you may need to install the USB Audio Class 2.0 Driver from Thesycon.
