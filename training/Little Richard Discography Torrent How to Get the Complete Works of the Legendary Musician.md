If you are wondering how Little Richard became such a legend, you need to go back to his early years. He was born as Richard Wayne Penniman on December 5, 1932, in Macon, Georgia. He was one of 12 children in a religious and musical family. He learned to sing and play piano at church, but he also had a rebellious streak. He was attracted to the secular music of blues, gospel, and rhythm and blues. He also faced discrimination and hardship because of his race and sexuality.
 
He started his musical career in the late 1940s, performing in various bands and clubs. He recorded his first songs in 1951, but they did not make much impact. He struggled to find his own style and voice. He was influenced by artists like Fats Domino, Ray Charles, and Sister Rosetta Tharpe. He also experimented with different genres, such as country, boogie-woogie, and jump blues.

The song became a hit, reaching number 2 on the Billboard R&B chart and number 17 on the pop chart. It also crossed over to the white audience, who were fascinated by Little Richard's flamboyant personality and appearance.
 
Little Richard followed up with more hits, such as "Long Tall Sally", "Rip It Up", "Lucille", and "Jenny Jenny". He became one of the most popular and influential rock and roll stars of the 1950s.
