The game features 16 stages, including eight Maverick stages and eight Nightmare stages. Each stage has its own theme, enemies, traps, puzzles, and boss. The Nightmare stages are affected by the Nightmare Phenomenon, which can change their layout, difficulty, and hazards depending on your actions in other stages. For example, if you defeat Metal Shark Player in his stage, his Nightmare effect will cause junk piles to appear in other stages, which can block your path or damage you.
 
The game also has multiple endings depending on your choices and performance in the game. You can unlock different endings by saving or not saving certain characters, defeating or not defeating certain bosses, or collecting or not collecting certain items. Some endings are more satisfying than others, so you might want to replay the game to see them all.
