In this article, we will show you how to use CIC Language Coding Utility 1.2 to process a sample data set that contains text in different languages. The data set is a collection of tweets about the 2020 US presidential election, extracted from Twitter using the hashtag #Election2020. The data set is available for download at [https://www.cic.washington.edu/cic-language-coding-utility-1-2/sample-data-set/](https://www.cic.washington.edu/cic-language-coding-utility-1-2/sample-data-set/).
 
The first step is to install CIC Language Coding Utility 1.2 on your computer. You can download the installation file from the official website of CIC at [https://www.cic.washington.edu/cic-language-coding-utility-1-2/](https://www.cic.washington.edu/cic-language-coding-utility-1-2/). After downloading the file, double-click on it and follow the instructions to complete the installation process.
 
The second step is to launch CIC Language Coding Utility 1.2 and open the sample data set. To do this, click on the "File" menu and select "Open". Then, browse to the folder where you saved the sample data set and select the file "tweets.csv". Click on "Open" and wait for the data to load.
 
The third step is to run the language detection and labeling function on the sample data set. To do this, click on the "Process" menu and select "Detect and Label Languages". A dialog box will appear, asking you to choose the column that contains the text to be processed. In this case, select the column "tweet\_text" and click on "OK". The program will then scan each tweet and assign a language code to it, based on its best guess. The language codes will be displayed in a new column called "language\_code".
 
The fourth step is to review and edit the language codes if necessary. To do this, scroll through the data and check if the language codes are correct. If you find any errors or inconsistencies, you can manually change the language codes by double-clicking on them and selecting a different option from the drop-down list. You can also use the "Find" and "Replace" functions to search for and modify specific language codes.
 
The fifth step is to perform any tasks on the labeled data that you want, such as filtering, sorting, grouping, summarizing, or exporting. For example, if you want to filter the data by language, you can click on the "Filter" button and select the language code that you want to keep. The program will then display only the tweets that match that language code. If you want to sort the data by date or by user name, you can click on the column header and choose either ascending or descending order. If you want to group the data by language or by source, you can click on the "Group" button and select the column that you want to group by. The program will then create subgroups for each unique value in that column. If you want to summarize the data by counting or calculating statistics for each group or for each column, you can click on the "Summarize" button and select the options that you want. The program will then generate a summary table with the results. If you want to export the labeled data to a different format, you can click on the "File" menu and select "Save As". Then, choose the format that you want from the list of options, such as plain text files (.txt), comma-separated values files (.csv), Microsoft Excel files (.xls), Microsoft Access files (.mdb), HTML files (.html), XML files (.xml), etc.
 
As you can see, CIC Language Coding Utility 1.2 is a simple yet powerful tool for multilingual data processing. It can help you save time and effort in dealing with data that contains text in different languages. It can also help you gain insights and knowledge from your data by performing various tasks on it.
