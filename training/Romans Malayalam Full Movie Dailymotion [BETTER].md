If you are wondering what the critics and the audience have to say about Romans Malayalam full movie, here are some reviews that might help you decide whether to watch it or not. The movie received mixed reviews from both the critics and the audience, with some praising its comedy and climax, and others criticizing its romance and logic.
 
The Times of India gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: "Romans works to an extent, courtesy Biju Menon and a tale that does not fail to flutter if not create a storm."[^1^] The reviewer appreciated Biju Menon's performance and dialogues, but found Kunchacko Boban's character unconvincing and weak. The reviewer also noted that the movie had some vain and meaningless attempts at romance and some illogical humour, but praised the director for putting together a weighty climax.
 
IMDb gave the movie 6.6 out of 10 based on 917 user ratings. One user wrote: "Romans seemed to be entertaining with the posters and cast promising high. But, in fact, it turns out to be a typical comedy thriller which you can both predict and not predict at the same time. Not much of intrigue is produced as the film advances. Boban & Menon are good but I loved Menon's humorous dialogs than Kunchacko's."[^2^] The user also mentioned that the movie had some good songs and cinematography, but lacked originality and freshness.
 
Nowrunning.com gave the movie 2 out of 5 stars and wrote: "Boban Samuel's 'Romans' is pretty much old-fashioned when it comes to the way it tells its story. Barring the once-in-a-blue moon gags that might induce a smile on your lips, it has nothing much appealing to crow about."[^3^] The reviewer criticized the movie for being predictable, cliched, and boring. The reviewer also found the romance between Kunchacko Boban and Nivetha Thomas uninteresting and forced.
