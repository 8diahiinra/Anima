## Stack and Layer Your Kick and Snare
 
One of the most important aspects of any drum track is the kick and snare sound. With Addictive Drums, you can easily customize your kick and snare by stacking and layering them with other kit pieces. For example, you can add a tambourine or a clap to your snare to give it more snap and presence, or you can add a sub-bass or a synth to your kick to give it more depth and punch. You can also adjust the volume, pan, pitch and envelope of each layer to fine-tune your sound.
 
To stack and layer your kick and snare, simply drag and drop any kit piece from the Kit page onto your kick or snare slot. You can add up to four layers per slot, and you can switch between them by clicking on the tabs at the bottom of the slot. You can also use the Solo and Mute buttons to isolate or mute each layer. To remove a layer, just drag it out of the slot.
 
## Use Snapshots to Compare and Evaluate Settings
 
Another feature that makes Addictive Drums easy to use is the Snapshot feature, which lets you quickly compare and evaluate different settings for your drum kit. You can use Snapshots to store up to four different settings for each kit piece, such as volume, pan, pitch, envelope, effects and more. You can then switch between them by clicking on the buttons at the top of the Kit page.
 
To create a Snapshot, simply adjust the settings for your kit piece as you like, then click on an empty Snapshot button to save it. You can also rename or delete a Snapshot by right-clicking on it. To recall a Snapshot, just click on its button. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts 1-4 to switch between Snapshots.
