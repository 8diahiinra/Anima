Pcsx2 is a popular emulator that allows you to play PS2 games on your PC. It requires DirectX to render the graphics and sound of the games. However, not all versions of DirectX are compatible with Pcsx2. If you have an older or newer version of DirectX than the one required by Pcsx2, you might encounter errors or performance issues.
