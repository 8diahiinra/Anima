DB Futhaira X is a Unicode font designed by DB Font, a leading Thai font foundry. It is based on the classic Samkan-4, Samkan-5 and Samkan-6 fonts, which were created by Sumkan Gosolwattana in the 1970s and resembled the Roman font Futura by Paul Renner. DB Futhaira X preserves the simple and elegant letterforms of Samkan, while adding more styles, weights and variations to suit different needs and preferences.

DB Futhaira X comes in two subsets: DB Futhaira Body and DB Futhaira Head, each having up to 30 styles with varied horizontal and vertical trackings. The styles range from Ultra Light to Extra Bold, and include Condensed, Rounded and Italic versions. The font also has minor adjustments to remove glyph confusion and improve readability. For example, the vowel signs à¹, à¹ and à¹ have lower heights, and the letters à¸£, à¸§ and à¸­ have curved backs instead of straight ones.
 
DB Futhaira X is a versatile font that can be used for various purposes, such as headlines, body text, logos, posters, menus and advertisements. It has a modern and sleek look that appeals to both Thai and international audiences. It is also compatible with other Latin fonts, especially Futura and its derivatives. DB Futhaira X is available for purchase from DB Font's website[^2^] [^5^], where you can also see more samples and details of the font[^1^].
  
DB Futhaira X is one of the many examples of Thai fonts that have been developed and improved over time. The history of Thai typography dates back to the early 19th century, when the first printing press was introduced by Western missionaries. The first printed Thai text was a Christian catechism published in 1819 by Dan Beach Bradley, an American missionary who also designed the first Thai metal type. [^1^]
 
Since then, Thai typography has evolved along with the social and political changes in the country. The printing of textbooks for a new education system and newspapers and magazines for a burgeoning press in the early 20th century spurred innovation in typography and type design. Various styles of Thai typefaces were developed, such as traditional, display and modern. Some of the influential type designers in this period were Sumkan Gosolwattana, Anuthin Wongsunkakon, Anake Nawigamune and Prachid Tinnabutr. [^1^]
 
The transition from metal type to digital type in the late 20th century brought new challenges and opportunities for Thai typography. The lack of copyright protection and standardization led to many unauthorized copies and modifications of existing fonts, as well as low-quality fonts that did not conform to the rules and aesthetics of the Thai script. However, it also opened up new possibilities for creativity and experimentation, as well as collaboration and communication among type designers and users. Several digital type foundries emerged, such as Cadson Demak, DIP Co., Ltd., Katatrad and Typomotion. [^1^]
 
Today, Thai typography is a vibrant and dynamic field that reflects the diversity and richness of Thai culture and language. It also interacts with other scripts and languages, especially Latin, as Thailand becomes more integrated with the global community. New technologies and platforms, such as web fonts, mobile devices and social media, also create new demands and expectations for Thai fonts. As a result, Thai type designers continue to explore new ways to express themselves and serve their audiences through their fonts.
