- **Intelligent Video Analysis:** This feature allows you to configure up to six filters for each camera, such as Intelligent Object Detection (IOD) and Intelligent Motion Detection (IMD), to detect intrusions or incidents based on predefined criteria. For example, you can set a filter to trigger an alarm or perform an action when a suspicious package is left unattended or when a person enters a restricted area. When an alarm is triggered, an on-screen box appears around the suspicious object or person - making it immediately obvious what has caused the alert situation[^2^]. This feature also helps to minimise false alarms caused by simple repetitive movements.
- **Customised Graphical Site Layouts:** This feature allows you to create customised graphical site layouts that show the locations of your cameras and other devices on a map or floor plan. You can also add icons, labels, links and notes to enhance the visualisation of your system[^2^].

You can also select a "hot spot" camera that will be displayed in full screen mode when an alarm is triggered or when you double-click on it[^2^].
- **Simultaneous Multi-Camera Playback and Rapid Playback Following Alarm Trigger:** This feature allows you to playback recorded video from multiple cameras at the same time on a single screen or on two separate screens. You can also playback video from a specific camera immediately after an alarm is triggered by clicking on the alarm icon[^2^].
- **Intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI):** This feature allows you to control and manage your system with ease using a simple and logical GUI. You can drag and drop cameras and devices onto the site layout, adjust camera settings, configure alarms and actions, view live and recorded video, search for events and export video clips[^2^].
