Mentor Graphics is a leading provider of software solutions for electronic design automation (EDA), including PADS, a suite of tools for printed circuit board (PCB) design. If you are using PADS Flow applications, you may need to upgrade your license server software periodically to ensure compatibility and performance.
 
In this article, we will show you how to check the minimum version of the license server software (lmgrd/mgcld) required for your PADS release, and how to upgrade it using the Mentor License Utility. We will also provide some links to video tutorials for more details.

## Checking the Minimum Version of the License Server Software
 
The license server software consists of two daemons: lmgrd and mgcld. The lmgrd daemon is a generic license manager that handles requests from clients, while the mgcld daemon is specific to Mentor Graphics products and performs license verification and enforcement.
 
The version of the lmgrd and mgcld daemons must match or exceed the minimum version required for your PADS release. Otherwise, you may encounter licensing errors or issues when running PADS applications. The table below shows the minimum version required for each PADS release[^1^]. Note that the lmgrd and mgcld daemons are backwards compatible for PADS releases v2003 and newer, so you can run a newer version to support older versions of PADS.

<br>The Mentor License Utility is a handy tool that allows you to perform various tasks related to licensing, such as querying and editing the licensing environment, installing and configuring the license server software, and generating diagnostic reports. You can download the "Full" version of the Mentor License Utility from SupportNet.<br>
<br>To upgrade the license server software using the Mentor License Utility, follow these steps:<br>
<ol>
<li>Run the Mentor_License_Utility_INSTALL.exe which extracts all the program files, creates a shortcut, and launches the Mentor License Utility program. (See README.txt for version information)</li>
<li>Navigate to, and select, the Setup > Upgrade License Manager menu option</li>
<li>Follow the remaining prompts to complete the license server upgrade</li>
</ol>
<br>The process is automated, and while the lmgrd and mgcld daemons should be down no more than a few seconds - and any checked out licenses should automatically reconnect - it is advisable to have all clients exit the PADS applications while the upgrade is performed.<br>
<br>If you prefer to upgrade the license server software manually, you can follow the instructions in this video.<br> 8cf37b1e13
