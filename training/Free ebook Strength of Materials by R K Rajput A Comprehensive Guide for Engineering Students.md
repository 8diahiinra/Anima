- Integrated SUBD Modeling tools: Users can create and edit subdivision surfaces with smooth transitions and sharp creases. Subdivision surfaces can be converted to NURBS surfaces for further refinement or analysis.
- Dynamic Shape Modeling: Users can quickly and easily manipulate curves and surfaces using direct modeling techniques. Dynamic Shape Modeling allows users to push, pull, twist, bend, and sculpt shapes intuitively.
- Rendering: Users can create realistic and stunning images of their designs using the integrated rendering engine. Rendering options include ray tracing, global illumination, ambient occlusion, depth of field, and more.
- Surface Evaluation: Users can analyze the quality and continuity of their surfaces using various tools such as curvature analysis, zebra stripes, reflection lines, draft angle analysis, etc.
- Painting: Users can apply colors, textures, decals, and logos to their models using the painting tools. Painting options include brush size, opacity, blending mode, projection mode, etc.
- Virtual Reality: Users can view their Alias content in virtual reality through a head-mounted display (HMD). Virtual reality allows users to immerse themselves in their designs and experience them in a realistic way.
- Generative Modeling: Users can create new modeling techniques with generative modeling using Dynamo. Dynamo is a visual programming tool that allows users to create parametric models using nodes and wires.

These are some of the features of Alias Design 2010 that make it a comprehensive and innovative software for industrial design.
