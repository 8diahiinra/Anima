In this article, we will explain what Trimble Business Center HCE can do for you and how it can benefit your construction projects.
 
## What is Trimble Business Center HCE?
 
Trimble Business Center HCE is a software solution that combines survey and construction functions in one platform. It allows you to quickly and easily create accurate, integrated 3D constructible models for construction surveying and machine control[^1^]. You can also perform data management and transfer, data review and editing, data preparation and takeoff, surface modeling and analysis, mass haul optimization, tunnel design and visualization, and more[^2^].
 
Trimble Business Center HCE is compatible with a range of Trimble hardware and software products, such as Trimble Siteworks Positioning Systems, Trimble Earthworks Grade Control Platform, Trimble WorksManager, Trimble GCS900 Grade Control System, Trimble SCS900 Site Controller Software, Trimble PCS900 Paving Control System, Trimble CCS900 Compaction Control System, OEM machine control systems based on GCS900, PCS900 and Earthworks[^1^]. It also integrates with Trimble Connected Community, a web-based service that enables file sharing and data visualization among project stakeholders[^2^].
 
## How Can Trimble Business Center HCE Benefit Your Construction Projects?
 
Trimble Business Center HCE can benefit your construction projects in many ways, such as:
 
- Save time and money by seamlessly managing data between the office and the field. You can import and export data from various sources and formats, ensure data quality and consistency, and transfer data wirelessly to your field devices or machine control systems[^1^] [^2^].
- Win more bids by quickly preparing accurate 3D constructible models for machine control and construction surveying. You can import and clean up CAD data, elevate contours, lines and points, create earthworks models for grading, drill plans and tunnel models, and generate reports and plots[^2^].
- Reduce rework by ensuring data is clean, current and delivered in the right format to get the job done. You can use CAD tools to trim, extend and offset lines, edit surfaces and alignments, check for errors and conflicts, and publish information in various formats[^2^].
- Increase efficiency and productivity by optimizing site and corridor earthworks. You can perform site takeoff and quantity estimating, road and corridor takeoff and quantity estimating, utility modeling, mass haul analysis and planning[^1^] [^2^].
- Enhance communication and collaboration by integrating with Trimble Connected Community. You can share files and data with your project team members, view data in 3D on a web browser or mobile device[^2^].
